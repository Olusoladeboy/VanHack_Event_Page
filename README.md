# VanHack's Event Page

The event types you should include are: MeetUp, Leap, Recruiting Mission, VanHackathon, Premium-only Webinar and Open Webinar. All of those should be displayed on your app – if they aren't, you won't be scored.

## FUNCTIONALITY (65% of your score)

By using your app, a user should be able to:
1. Apply to events and see confirmation of their application – if this functionality doesn't work, your score will be 0. 
2. See more details of an event
3. Share the event with a friend (through either LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc – your choice)
4. See a friendly error warning when trying to apply for a Premium-only webinar, with a button for the candidate to read more about Premium/buy a membership plan

## DESIGN (35% of your score)

Your only design restraints are:
1. Leap, Mission and VanHackathon events should visually stand out to candidates the most (there are many ways you can do this, and you will be scored as long as there is a perceivable design difference between the way these events are shown and the other events)
2. Premium-only webinars should be visually distinguished from the “open for all” webinars (with a perceivable design difference – writing "Premium" in bold isn't enough!)
3. Your page design must be original and not be a copy of ours or of any other candidate's; we will assign extra points for great design
